# Re-Protest
Creating this since reddit sucks.
Pulls and saves all your comments, then rewrites them to display a custom message.

## Why?
Reddit has introduced a controversial API pricing model, essentially killing 3rd party apps instead of working with the developers. To show solidarity, many subs are going private, and users have started removing their comments.  
This script aims to help preserve the comments before removing them, making it possible to restore them at a later point in time if reddit were to roll-back their changes.

The comments themselves will remain, but their content will be lost. 
This should prevent most archivers, scrapers, and LLM systems from saving and/or using the comments, provided they haven't been scraped already.
